# Combining_Image
It's a small project where you can change the background of an image using another image.

### For understanding
When you open the website, you are suppose to select two images 
- Front Image
- Backgroung Image
After selecting the respective images, you have to click on create composite where the background of the first image will get replaced with the secand image and the pixels will be of the first image.

ðŸ’¡TRY KEEPING BACKGROUND IMAGE DARKER THAN FRONT IMAGE FOR BETTER COMPOSITEðŸ‘Œ
